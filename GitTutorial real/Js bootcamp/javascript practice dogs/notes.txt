public apis- on git hub go to public apis-scroll down
go to animals - dogs

Endpoints - are just URL'S 

fetch ()- is a web browser function, its not
only returning data but a promise

A promise- meaning it won't stop other programs 
from running even though its the first line
It has a method named then() (you can give it A
function as an arguement and it will wait to call 
the then functin until the first code is completed)

ex.fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all").then()

fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all").then(function(response){
    return response.json()
}).then()

the response - the fetch url server response

const response = await fetch("")
the await fetch() makes sure that the other code will not run 
until what's inside the await will run

The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list. 
The <select> element is most often used in a form, to collect 
user input. The name attribute is needed to reference the form
 data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, 
 no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).
